                <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Avul pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> is Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who 
                    served as the 11th president of India from 2002 
                    to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram,
                    Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
                    engineering. He spent the next four decades as
                    a scientist and science administrator, mainly 
                    at the Defence Research and Development
                    Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research 
                    Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved 
                    in India's civilian space programme and military 
                    missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be 
                    known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the 
                    development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle 
                    technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal 
                    organisational, technical, and political role in 
                    India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first 
                    since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.[5]
